    Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather 
    than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly 
    any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's 
    seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper.
     An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, "bookworm". A place where books are traded is
      a bookshop or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. Google has estimated 
      that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published.[2] In some wealthier nations, the sale of
       printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks.[3] Although in most countries printed books
        continue to outsell their digital counterparts due to many people still preferring to read in a traditional way.[4][5][6]
